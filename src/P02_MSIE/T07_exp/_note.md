# Todo

- Symmetric action space
- Normalization of observations
- Experiment with different seeds for the starting solution
- Cap the maximum reward.
- Experiment with `target_solution` that is higher than the target solution, but keep the high value even the solution is below target_solution.
- Migration logic flipped ✅
- Min-max population ✅
- Adjust bounds input ✅
- Add bounds check ✅
