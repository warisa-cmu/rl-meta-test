# Todo

- Symmetric action space
- Normalization of observations
- Migration upper and lower bounds ✅
- Migration logic ✅
- Experiment with different seeds for the starting solution
- Cap the maximum reward.
- Experiment with `target_solution` that is higher than the target solution, but keep the high value even the solution is below target_solution.
